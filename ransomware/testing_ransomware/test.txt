Early life

Cavinder was born in South Bend, Indiana,[1] one minute after and one pound (454 g) lighter than her twin sister, Haley.[2] The family moved to the Phoenix area by the twins' age 3.[2] The twins often opted for basketball time in the driveway instead of "Sesame Street" time before going to preschool, even though they had no hoop assembly and just did YouTube drills.[3] They tried many sports in their early years before focusing on basketball and emulating Skylar Diggins-Smith in junior high.[4] The twins were adventerous athletes from a young age and competed against boys in basketball until sixth grade. When they joined a girls team in middle school, they competed with and against girls a few years older.[5] In club basketball, they participated in 15â€“17 age competition as sixth graders.[4] They got their first scholarship offers before their freshman season from San Diego.[5]
